PAPER REQUIREMENTS:
Additionally, your executive summary should include which algorithm you think will perform better on the test set,
and your support for that decision. Based on your model development process, include estimates for the test AUCs for each model. 
The estimates should be in a table and rounded to four decimal places.
Finally, describe how you would demonstrate to a business partner that one model is better than the other without 
using a scoring metric.

INTRODUCTION:
Logistic regression (GLM), Linear regression and KNN (SLM) are my three favorite classification models.
All of them are simple, easy to use, and implement. Therefore, I chose KNN as my second data model. 
In this particular exercise, the KNN generated an AUC of 0.9595. The logistic regression produced an AUC of 0.6216. 
I additionally performed a linear regression which produced a 0.9189 AUC. 
herefore, the KNN and linear regression provided better results than the logistic regression. 
However, I believe I could improve the logistc regression results by finding
certain columns that might not be revelant and giving the better columns a higher value. 

Additionally, I added a decision tree, support vector, and an automation project.
These models will be discssed individually later and how they could be improved for better AUC later.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION (GLM):
Logistic regression requires a lot of datasets. 
In this case, it was not an issue as there were 10,000 rows for less than 100 features.
Some believe that there should be 10x more rows than features. This fit this description.
Overfitting is an isssue if there are more features than datapoints. 
One disavantage of logistic regression is having to sometimes scale features.

KNN Classification (SLM):
The major disavantage of KNN is slow runtime since KNN has to calculate distance between points.
When there are more than 50,000 rows, KNN can become slow.
With only 10,000 rows, I knew that KNN would not have a runtime issue in this case.
This made KNN the perfect second choice for my classification model.
Also, KNN is sensitive to missing data points and outliers.
The data was successfully cleaned using simple techniques for now.

My error_rate said that 3 was the best performer for n_neighbors. 
KNN initial precision was 0.894, however, this number was a bit decieving because I had used 
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 5.) 
When I tried model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 7),
precision dropped to  0.82.

LINEAR REGRESSION:
As expected, the linear regression performed better than logistic with a 0.9189 AUC.
Linear regression is a simple, popular, and powerful model.
One disavantage of linear regression is it is prone to overfitting and outliers. 
However, the model performed well even without removing any outliers.

RANDOM FOREST:
Generally, random forest is one of the best models to use.
The decision tree AUC is 0.3788 but the precision was .93. This is a very rare occurance that should not happen.
After looking at the Python code, there was no real answer of why the AUC would be so low.
However, underfitting can often occur with decision trees. 
Therefore, one must carefully select the features carefully when using a decision tree. 
Using specific features would likely increase the AUC to a more natural probability.

SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM):
The AUC for SVM was .50 which is not a very good result for this excercise. 
Normally, SVM is a very powerful and complex model that works well as long as there are sufficient data points.
One disavantage with SVM (and neural networks) is that it is much more complex and be extremely difficult 
to explain to others. Oftimes, doing a more simople linear (logistic) regression, KNN, or random forest is 
better simply because its more simple.

AUTOMATION PROJECT:
I invented an automation data science Python project to find the best feature variables (columns x1 to x100) that have the highest significance
by taking each column individually to compare it to df['y'], the independent variable:
For this project, I used r-squared because it is my favorite metric since it combines probability with amount of samples.
At the end, I stored the results into a dictionary with a key and value. 
Then at the very end, I print out the five highest r_squared values within the dictionary. 

An additional cool project to do would be to use a Python intertools permutations script to calculate every combination for each
column to detect which combo provides the best outcome.

DEMONSTRATE TO BUSINESS MODEL:
When describing a data model (especially to a non techncal person), it is best to use simple and give
a short business answer. Also, using a simple data model is easier for other employees and customers to 
understand. Therefore, using linear, logistic, and KNN are good models to use.

A good example would be this: "This model is better because it had a higher r-squared. 
The higher the r-squared the better the probability. R2 adjusts for the amount of datapoints so it is
a well trusted probability."

A bad example describing a data model (especially to a non technicial person) would be using 
complex words (often just to "look smart") that people will not understand.
For example, "Support Vector model is the better model because it uses data points that are closer to the hyperplane and 
influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane to maximize the margin of the classifier."

This answer is not visually appealing and would be hard for someone to understand. 
Oftentime, the best way to describe a model is to your graphs and data visualizing. 
I know that when I first learned KNN nearest means a simple graph ("is this a cat or dog") helped me understand
the KNN data model rather than reading scholarly articles on it. In summary, sometimes simple is better.


NEURAL NETWORK (IN PROGRESS):
A big disavantage of neural network is that it is difficult to understand. 
Therefore, it becomes challenging to explain to others.
However, with that being said, I thought it would fun to code.
