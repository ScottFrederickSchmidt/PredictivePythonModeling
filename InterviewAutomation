'''
Automation attempt to find the best feature variables (columns x1 to x100) that have the highest significance
by taking each column individually to compare it to df['y'], the independent variable. 
For this project, I used r-squared because it is my favorite metric since it combines probability with amount of samples.
At the end, I stored the results into a dictionary with a key and value. 
This would help someone else to easily maniuplate the information (such as what are the five highest probability columns?).
