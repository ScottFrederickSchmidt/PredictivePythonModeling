INTRODUCTION TO LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
Logistic regression should be used for "yes" or "no" questions.
Does person have heart disease? Will the person graduate?

y=B0 + B1 X
P = 0 and 1 #probability


#Import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Import Dataset:
df=pd.read_csv("Advertisement.csv")
x=df.iloc[, [2,3]].values
y=df.iloc[: 4].values

#Encoding categorical variables:
from sklearn.preprcessing import labelEncoder
label_encoder_y = labelEncoder()
y= label_encoder_y.fit_transform(y)

# Splitting dataset into training set and test set
from sklear.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size =0.25, random_state=0)

#Feature scaling:
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc_x=StandardScaler()
x_train=sc_x.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test=sc_x.transform(x_test)

#Fitting Logistic Regressiont into training set:
from sklearn.linear_model import Logistic Regression
classifier = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
classifier.it(x_train, y_train)

Confusion Matrix:

H0: Bought;         Positive
H1: Did not bought; Negative

Definition: confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, labels=None, simple_weight=None)
Type: Function in sklearn metrics classification module.
